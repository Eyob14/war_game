"War" is a popular children's card game that is easy to learn and can be played with just two players. The game begins with each player receiving half of the full deck of cards, which are divided between them. The objective of the game is to collect all the cards, and the player who manages to do so is declared the winner.

During each turn, both players will reveal the top card of their respective piles simultaneously. The player with the card of the highest rank will collect both cards and add them to their pile. In the event that both players reveal cards of the same rank, the game enters a state of "war."

During war, each player will place three additional cards face down on the table before revealing the fourth card. The player with the higher rank card will collect all the cards on the table, including the six cards that were played. If both players reveal cards of the same rank again, the game will enter another round of war until one player wins.

It's important to note that jokers have the highest rank in this game, followed by ace, king, queen, jack, and then descending down to the two. The game will continue in this fashion until one player has collected all of the cards.
